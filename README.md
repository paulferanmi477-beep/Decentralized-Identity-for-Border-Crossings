# 🌍 Decentralized Identity for Border Crossings

Welcome to a secure and efficient way to manage identities for international travel using the Stacks blockchain! This project lets users control their identity data and enables border authorities to verify credentials quickly and securely.

## ✨ Features

🔐 Register your identity with a unique hash  
✅ Issue and verify credentials like passports or visas  
⏰ Log border crossings immutably  
🔍 Verify identity without revealing sensitive data  
🚫 Prevent fraudulent or duplicate identities  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Travelers**  
- Generate a hash of your identity data  
- Call `register-identity` with:  
  - Your identity hash  
  - Your public key  
- Request credentials (e.g., passport, visa) from issuers  
- Present credentials at borders for instant verification  

**For Border Authorities**  
- Use `verify-credential` to check passports or visas  
- Access `get-travel-history` for crossing records  
- Confirm identity ownership securely
